## Ruby Exercisms

Ruby challenges to keep me on my toes!

These challenges are from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) check them out! They have several languages to test your skills. Easy to install and focused on test driven development. I would just suggest they automatically ``` require 'minitest/pride' ```so you can have ranbow dots. Who doesn't like a little color to spice up their life. 

Give my code a look and I would love some feedback/critiques on my [solutions](http://exercism.io/damenate).
